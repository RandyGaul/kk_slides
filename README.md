Some "slides" about coroutines in C, presented as a university guest lecture at DigiPen IT in Redmond WA. There was a video recording done, so hopefully a youtube video will appear eventually.

Simply run `run.bat`, it should use bash or WIN32 console commands and run pretty much everywhere. Press any key except the left arrow to continue. Left arrow resets the current slide.
