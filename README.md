Some "slides" about coroutines in C, presented as a university guest lecture at DigiPen IT in Redmond WA

Build and run the executable with MSVC (Windows only). Press any key except the left arrow to continue. Left arrow resets the current slide.

g++ is expected to be installed to compile + run code live :)
